# Pseudo Linux Bash Terminal on Web

The purpose of this app is **NOT** to emulate a true Terminal. It is designed to let website owners give a web based Pseudo Terminal to their users who can run linux commands.

**Unique Features**

- **No typing lag** Unlike any other web Terminal emulation on the web (or a remote SSH client), which reports every keypress to the backend & eventually slowing down the typing, this app only sends data when 'enter' key is pressed making typing of commands super-fast.
- **Super fast execution & data transfer** The app uses Node.js backend & [SockJS](http://sockjs.org) for communication. You probably cant get anything else doing things faster than what the two beasts are doing. Scroll down to check latency figures.
- **Works for users behind proxy** One of the most popular project [Gateone](http://github.com/liftoff/GateOne) which solved the problem, does not work behind proxy. Since this project has SockJS, the communication protocol degrades to a non-websocket protocol behind proxy keeping the functionality alive.

**Cons**

- **Bash shortcuts do not work**  ~~Bash shortcuts like tab autocomplete, previous/next command navigation using up/down arrow key etc does not work.~~ The data is sent to the server only on 'enter' press & the response is populated in the output area.
  **Update** - Autocomplete works the native way now. Command navigation is handled on the javascript side so it does NOT persist across page load. Other complicated bash shortcuts wont work. 
- **Can not run Vim/Emacs** Again since every keypress does not get reported, things simply hung while running Vim or Emacs.

Check the [live demo](http://pocha.github.io/terminal-codelearn). The app is currently deployed in production in [Codelearn Playground](http://www.codelearn.org/apps/code_play).

> Note : Server side security is not covered as part of this app. You need to jail the Terminal user & limit his system privileges using /etc/security/limits.conf . 

### Additional Features


**1. Multi user support**
Set `USERNAME` & `SIGNATURE` variable in public/client.html to spawn Terminal as a linux user with the USERNAME value you specified. `SIGNATURE` is a ssha encrypted USERNAME with `secret` (defined in lib/config.js . Feel free to change it).

While integrating the Terminal in your app, you need to 'externally' generate SIGNATURE for the USERNAME & set the value in public/client.html . Here is a Node.js code to generate the same
      

      crypto = require('crypto')
	  var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha1', Config.secret) //change secret to the key inside lib/config.js
      hmac.update(USERNAME)
      SIGNATURE = hmac.digest('hex')


You may leave USERNAME & SIGNATURE empty in public/client.html . In that case, the user with which the server was started will be the owner of the Terminal.

**2. Terminal command logging in Mongodb**
The application logs each command executed by the user with it's output and time at which it was executed in MongoDB. [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) is an open source and a NoSQL database. You can follow the [Installation Guide](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation) to install MongoDb on your specific platform.


**3. Error intimation emails to admin**
This application uses [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer) to send email about errors. You can change the settings according to yourself in the file `lib/mailer.js`. The response whether the email was succesful or not is logged in the `email.log` file. 


**4. Logging**
This application logs all the errors in the `err.log` file.
Also all the miscellaneous logs are logged in the `out.log` file.


### Latency

**How-to run benchmark tests**

For server side Benchmarking, checkout the server-profiling branch

	git checkout server-profiling

Now run the server. In this benchmarking, results are averaged out over all the commands that a particular user runs as well as over the numbers of users who have been connected till now. 

> Note: To reset the averages, restart the server.

For client side Benchmarking, there are two scripts available in the benchmarking directory. You can run the scripts by

	node <script_name>

+ `multiple-clients.js` Opens multiple connections to a single server and sends a particular number of messages through each connection. The average time per user per message at a particular concurrency level is recorded in `output-mutltiple.dat` file.

+ `single-client.js` Opens a single connection to the server and sends a particular number of messages . The time taken for the client to receive the output from the server for each request is recorded in `output-single.dat` file.


**Benchmarking Results**

The scripts in benchmark directory were used to generate the graphs.The server and the client specifications are given below

1. Server configuration

   + CPU : Intel Core i7 920 @ 2.67GHz
   + CPU cores : 4
   + Memory : 11.72 GB

2. Client configuration

   + CPU : Intel Xeon E5645 @ 2.40GHz
   + CPU cores : 1
   + Memory : 595 MB
 
Server to Client ping delay = 98.9 ms

Each message sent to the server was the 'whoami' command of which the server returned the output.

**Single client benchmark data**
The graph below shows the client side delay measured when a single client is connected to the server.

![Single Client Graph](https://raw.github.com/pocha/terminal-codelearn/master/graphs/single-client.png)
   
The blue lines give the minimum and the maximum of the dataset while the green one shows the average of the whole data

**Multiple clients benchmark data**
This test tries to emulate multiple browsers connecting and interacting with the server.

The Y-axis of the graph below shows the average time taken by the server to respond to a request . This time is measured on the server because the  client script introduces delay in processing the messages it receives from the server.

The X-axis of the graph gives the total number of concurrent users connected to the server. 

![Multiple Clients Graph](https://raw.github.com/pocha/terminal-codelearn/master/graphs/multiple-clients.png)

This graph measures the time taken upto 506 clients only. More than 506 clients are not able to connect because 'pty.js' modules gives error that 'forkpty(3) failed'.

### Installation

Install the modules required to run the application.

	npm install --production

Start the server.

	npm start

This will start the server at port 1134.

Now go to **http://localhost:1134/client.html** to see the application running.

To start the server as daemon you can use [Forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever).
Install Forever by

	npm install forever -g

Now you can start the server as daemon

	forever start app.js


### Mocha tests

Install the modules required for testing.

	npm install --dev

Install [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) by

	npm install -g mocha

Run the Mocha tests
  
	sudo mocha -r should -R spec
